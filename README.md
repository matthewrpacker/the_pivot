Nosebleed Tickets is a satirical site that sells bad seats to fictional events from 10 categories. This project built upon base functionality (outlined below) and integrated multi-tenancy, allowing multiple venues (businesses) to sell tickets to events. Additionally, users now gain the ability to edit their account, and a platform admin can approve or deny new venues. Venue administrators can edit their events, and the platform administrator can edit all events, remove venues, edit venue admin accounts, and update venue information.

QR code generation is also integrated in order confirmation emails.

This brownfield project is built off of the repo [One Fan's Treasure](https://github.com/Laner12/little_shop), which was an exploration into e-commerce with Rails. CRUD, authorization, and authentication were all fully utilized in that project to allow a user to create an account, purchase items, and receive confirmation. An administrator has additional privileges (i.e., the ability to edit their account).

Extensions in One Fan's Treasure included e-mail confirmation, Stripe for payment processing, OAuth (Twitter), image upload and storage via Paperclip and AWS, and dynamic search.
